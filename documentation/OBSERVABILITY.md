# Observability

This document describes the active observability model used by runtime and host integrations.

## Signal Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Runtime[Runtime event] --> Metrics[Metrics aggregation]
    Runtime --> Audit[Audit records]
    Runtime --> Trace[Tracing hooks]
    Metrics --> Export[Host export adapters]
    Audit --> Export
    Trace --> Export
```

## Current Signals

- Latency summaries and operational counters.
- Structured audit trail records for policy and tool decisions.
- Correlation-ID aware event propagation.
- Host-facing export points for external telemetry systems.

## Validation

- Use `tests/observability/observability_tests.rs` for behavior checks.
- Keep metric naming stable across minor updates.
