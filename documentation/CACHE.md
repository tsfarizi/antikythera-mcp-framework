# Cache

This document describes the active binary cache model for configuration data.

## Cache Lifecycle

flowchart TD
    Source[Configuration source] --> Encode[Postcard encode]
    Encode --> File[Binary cache artifact]
    File --> Decode[Postcard decode]
    Decode --> Runtime[Runtime configuration use]
```

## Current Behavior

- Binary configuration artifacts reduce parse overhead on repeated loads.
- Cache decoding is tied to active schema compatibility checks.
- Runtime uses cache artifacts only when integrity checks pass.

## Operational Guidance

- Rebuild cache after schema-affecting updates.
- Keep import/export procedures aligned with cache format expectations.
