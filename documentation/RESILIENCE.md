# Runtime Resilience

This document describes active resilience controls in runtime execution.

## Resilience Control Loop

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Task[Task execution] --> Retry[Retry policy]
    Task --> Timeout[Timeout policy]
    Task --> Context[Context-window controls]
    Task --> Health[Health tracking]
    Retry --> Outcome[Execution outcome]
    Timeout --> Outcome
    Context --> Outcome
    Health --> Outcome
```

## Current Modules

- Retry/backoff behavior with explicit conditions.
- Timeout enforcement for bounded execution.
- Context-window handling to control prompt growth.
- Health-tracker surfaces for runtime state reporting.

## Validation

- Covered by resilience tests under `tests/resilience/`.
- Integrates with guardrails and observability for production flows.
