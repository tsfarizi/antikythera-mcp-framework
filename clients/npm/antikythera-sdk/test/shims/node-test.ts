/**
 * node:test → bun:test compatibility shim.
 *
 * WHY: bun's resolver does not implement the `node:test` specifier, so
 * `bun test` fails on suites that import it. Bun honors tsconfig `paths`
 * at runtime, so this shim (mapped from `"node:test"` in ../tsconfig.json)
 * lets the same .mjs suite run under both runtimes. Node never reads
 * tsconfig paths and keeps its native node:test — this file is inert there.
 *
 * SEMANTIC DEVIATIONS (documented, accepted):
 *  1. Assertion style: suites use `node:assert/strict`, which bun implements
 *     natively; only the TEST RUNNER surface is shimmed here.
 *  2. `beforeEach`/`afterEach`: mapped to bun's same-named hooks when present;
 *     on builds lacking them they fall back to `beforeAll`/`afterAll`, which
 *     run ONCE per scope instead of per test — per-test isolation is weaker
 *     on that fallback path (bun >= 1.x always has the real hooks).
 *  3. `test(name, options, fn)`: the options object is forwarded verbatim;
 *     option keys unknown to bun (e.g. node's `skip` reason object shape) are
 *     ignored by bun rather than erroring.
 *  4. Node-only runner APIs (`test.skip`, `test.only` as property calls,
 *     `run()`) are NOT provided: neither target suite uses them.
