//! Comprehensive Logging Module Tests
//!
//! Extensive test suite for antikythera-log with focus on:
//! - Edge cases and boundary conditions
//! - Concurrency safety and race conditions
//! - Security: input validation, injection prevention
//! - Performance: memory leaks, bounds
//! - Panic safety: no unwrap/expect in hot paths
//! - Data integrity: serialization, ordering

// Split by concern to keep file size manageable and improve readability.
