//! Discovery Types
//!
//! This module defines the core types used for MCP server discovery.
//! These types represent the results of scanning a servers folder
//! and loading server binaries to fetch their available tools.

/// This struct holds metadata about a server binary found in the servers folder,
/// along with the tools it provides (if successfully loaded).

///     binary_path: PathBuf::from("servers/mcp-time.exe"),
